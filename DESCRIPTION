Version: 0.1.0

Description: Every year on February 2, the famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil, and a growing cast of creatures (including stuffed animals, sock puppets, and mascots), emerge from their burrows to predict the weather. Punxsutawney Phil, the prognosticator of prognosticators, has been predicting the weather since 1887. If he sees his shadow, his prediction is for six more weeks of winter. If not, he predicts an early spring.   
    This package brings together prediction data from countdowntogroundhogday.com and weather data from the U.S. National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to help you evaluate which prognosticators you can trust.
