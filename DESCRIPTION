Title: Groundhog Day Prediction Data and Accuracy Metrics
Version: 0.2.1
Author: Eric Green
Maintainer: Eric Green <epgreen@gmail.com>
Description: Every year on February 2, Groundhog Day, the famous groundhog
    Punxsutawney Phil, and a growing cast of creatures (including stuffed
    animals, sock puppets, and mascots), emerge from their burrows to predict
    the weather. Punxsutawney Phil, the prognosticator of prognosticators, has
    been predicting the weather since 1887. If he sees his shadow, his
    prediction is for six more weeks of winter. If not, he predicts an early
    spring. This package brings together prediction data from
    countdowntogroundhogday.com and weather data from Open-Meteo (ERA5
    reanalysis) to help you evaluate which prognosticators you can trust.
