\title{Weather classifications, definition 1}
\format{
A data frame with 3 columns:
\describe{
  \item{prognosticator_city}{Where the prognosticator is located}
  \item{year}{Classification year}
  \item{class}{Classification: "Early Spring", "Long Winter", or NA}
}
}

\usage{
class_def1
}
\description{
A table listing early spring/long winter classifications for each prognosticator's city by year. The definition of "early spring" follows previous analyses by NOAA and 538 in classifying a year as "early spring" if the average temperature in February OR March is above the 15-year running average for the location.

\section{Data Sources}{

Weather data comes from two sources:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{1940-present}: Open-Meteo ERA5 reanalysis data for all 158 prognosticator cities
  \item \strong{Pre-1940}: NOAA GHCND historical data for Punxsutawney, PA and Quarryville, PA only
}
}

\section{Missing Values (NA)}{

Approximately 16\% of classifications are NA due to:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{Insufficient history for rolling average} (~98\% of NAs): The 15-year rolling average requires 14 prior years of data. For most cities with data starting in 1940, classifications begin in 1954.
  \item \strong{Missing weather data} (~2\% of NAs): Some early years have gaps in GHCND records (e.g., Punxsutawney 1887-1892, 1906-1910).
