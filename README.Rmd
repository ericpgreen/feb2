## Overview

Every year on February 2, [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day), the famous groundhog [Punxsutawney Phil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punxsutawney_Phil)—and a growing cast of creatures (including stuffed animals, sock puppets, and mascots)—emerge from their burrows to predict the weather. Punxsutawney Phil, the prognosticator of prognosticators, has been predicting the weather since 1887. If he sees his shadow, his prediction is for six more weeks of winter. If not, he predicts an early spring. 

This package brings together prediction data from [Countdown to Groundhog Day](https://countdowntogroundhogday.com/) and weather data from the [U.S. National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/) to help you evaluate which prognosticators you can trust. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("ericpgreen/feb2")
```

## Usage

Currently this is a function-less data package designed to facilitate your analyses of Groundhog Day prediction data. 

```{r library}
library(feb2)
```


## Datasets

There are three main datasets and several supporting datasets.

```{r img, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Datasets"}
  knitr::include_graphics(path="man/figures/feb2 data.svg")
```

### `prognosticators`

Michael Venos, the creator of [Countdown to Groundhog Day](https://countdowntogroundhogday.com/), maintains the internet's most comprehensive database about Groundhog Day predictions. He generously agreed to allow me to incorporate his data into this package. Currently he has data on a diverse collection of `r nrow(prognosticators)` prognosticators. 

```{r prognosticators, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
prognosticators %>%
  group_by(prognosticator_status) %>%
  count()
```

Rodents are by far the most common prognosticators. One lobster is holding it down for the arthropods.

```{r prognosticators-type}
prognosticators %>%
  group_by(prognosticator_phylum, prognosticator_class, prognosticator_order) %>%
  count()
```

### `predictions`

Michael has collected `r nrow(predictions)` predictions going back to Punxsutawney Phil's first prediction in 1887. Some years the prediction is uncertain or not recorded, accounting for the `NA`s.

```{r predictions}
predictions %>%
  group_by(prediction) %>%
  count()
```

### `weather_stations_ghcnd`

Each prognosticator is linked to a city. I used the {`tidygeocoder`} package to get coordinates for each city and then searched for weather stations with TMAX (daily max air temperature) data within 100km of each city's coordinates using the `meteo_nearby_stations()` function in the {`rnoaa`} package. This dataset lists every eligible weather station within 100km, but the package only uses weather data from (up to) the 10 closest stations.

```{r map, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
states <- geojsonio::geojson_read("https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/json/us-states.geojson", 
                                  what = "sp")

leaflet(data = states) %>%
  setView(-96, 37.8, 4) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Toner) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data = weather_stations_ghcnd,
                   lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude, radius=0.5)
```

```{r map2, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(rnaturalearth)
library(sp)

state_prov <- rnaturalearth::ne_states(c("united states of america", "canada"),
                                       returnclass = "sf") %>%
  filter(name != "Hawaii") %>%
  filter(name != "Alaska")

ggplot(data = state_prov) + 
  geom_sf() +
  geom_point(data = weather_stations_ghcnd, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude),
             size=0.25, alpha = 0.4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "NOAA weather stations within 100km of prognosticators",
       x=NULL,
       y=NULL) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold"),
        plot.title.position = "plot")
```



### `class_def1`

The biggest challenge for evaluating Groundhog Day predictions is defining what we mean by "early spring". So far in this package I follow the general approach of earlier analyses by [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/groundhog-day-forecasts-and-climate-history) and [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/groundhogs-do-not-make-good-meteorologists/)—with one difference. I define early spring for a prognosticator's location as one month (February OR March) with an average high temperature above the historical average for that month. Unlike the previous analyses, however, I use local data for each prognosticator. NOAA used U.S. national temperatures, and 538 looked across nine U.S. regions. I refer to classifications based on this definition `def1`. 

The `class_def1` dataset does not contain the underlying weather data, but you can find it in `class_def1_data`. You can also use the {`rnoaa`} package and the weather station information in `weather_stations_ghcnd` and `weather_stations_isd` to query the weather data directly if you are interested in creating a new classification definition.

## Updates

I plan to update the prognosticators, predictions, and classifications data after the month of March (classification definition `def1` depends on March weather data).

## Data Use

NOAA weather data are in the public domain (as far as I know). Data on prognosticators and their predictions come with permission from [Countdown to Groundhog Day](https://countdowntogroundhogday.com/). You are welcome to use the data via this package for any purpose, but please do not post the raw data on any other public sites. Instead, give credit to Michael's tremendous effort by pointing back to [Countdown to Groundhog Day](https://countdowntogroundhogday.com/).
